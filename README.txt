	In this code, I updated the code I had from assignment 1. I made use of the table feature in order to create a large table of coloured squares for design on the main page, and updated it with css that targeted the padding, border, and margin. Because of this, the entire main website is divided into different rows and columns of one big table, which I think looks pretty nice. The colours were found using https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp.

The coaching subpage is a bunch of flex boxes in a pile formation, making use of all the same colours as the main page to keep consistency throughout the site. The same was done with the computer science and pet zone sub pages.

In order to learn how to do certain functions (embedding the different kinds of links, and remembering how to include a favicon), I asked ChatGPT. I never copied any of the code given to me, and used it purely to remember what I needed to do.

None of the images or videos I used were owned by anyone but me (besides the hedgehog emoji, credited below[1]), however the audio file is an unreleased Portraits Of Tracy song [2] that was posted in her Discord server. 
 
The head function of this code provides the tab title and favicon. The body function contains the large table that contains all of the website's information, along with plenty of links to various images and videos;

	- links to the other pages, coaching.html and cs.html
		- coaching.html is a page that details my coaching experiences more in depth.
		- cs.html is a page that details my experience with coding and computer science so far.
	- links to all the images, hedgehog.png (favicon), letsgo.jpeg, mona.jpeg, promeekah.jpeg, teaching.jpeg, and verypromeekah.jpeg
	- links to 3 Processing files in the java programming language, with the titles PONG.zip, Particles.zip, and Filter.zip.
	- link to a video file titled pop off.mov and a link to a YouTube video showcasing a geometry dash level called RAID made by me on my own YouTube channel [3].

	- the petzone.html subpage contains tons of other images owned by me of my pets. Their names are the following;
