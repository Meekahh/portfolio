                        In my introductory computer science courses, I completed many assignments. 
                        The three I feel are most notable are the three mentioned on my resume; 
                        my PONG recreation, my image filter, and my particle system.

                    <div class="grid-item2">
                        Firstly, I remade PONG from scratch. While not a particularly itensive task by any means, 
                        it was a good baseline for starting out and a lot of fun! Then, I spent some time working with the "pixels" array 
                        in order to make a pixel-by-pixel image altering program--which I thought was pretty cool. Finally, the particle 
                        system I made was a simple one; click, and you see a little "firework". This was my first dive into working with objects, 
                        and it taught me a lot!
                            </div>
                    <div class="grid-item3">
                        I also have a lot of experience with creating worlds for players to interact with, albeit through in-game editors as 
                        opposed to real game engines. However, making levels in Geometry Dash actually involves a lot of coding-adjacent elements, 
                        such as "triggers" which are essentially the game's version of a programming language.
