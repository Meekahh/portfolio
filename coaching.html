                        I've spent a ton of time coaching all kinds of different things. I find great satisfaction in watching my students
                        learn and grow, and I have learned a lot about how the human brain likes to process things along the way.
                        All of this experience has caused me to be quite proficient in effectively coaching people through just about 
                        anything I'm half-decent at.

                        My first instruction job was as a swimming instructor. I taught at both the Canada Games Centre, and the Spryfield 
                        Wave Pool. As I did competitive swimming for years before beginning to teach, along with being the captain of the Water Polo
                        team I eventually joined after I quit competitive swimming, I was often made to be the instructor for the higher levels of 
                        swimming. This helped me develop a coaching style that works very well with the "pre-teen" age group, and also formed a love
                        for teaching things at the absolute highest level whenever possible.

                        After that, I began teaching Skiing at Martock Ski Resort--something I still do every now and again as a volunteer, just because 
                        I enjoyed it so much! I got to work with people of all kinds of different cultures, and often got to learn about the lives 
                        of recent Canadian immigrants. Working with adults from other countries who were looking to learn a new skill after moving 
                        to a brand new country was an absolute blessing, and I occasionally hear from them through eMail when they complete a high 
                        difficulty hill!

                        Just this summer, I began teaching Sailing at Armdale Yacht Club. I have been sailing ever since I was 7 years old, and I ended up reaching the 
                        second highest level possible for Canadian Sailing! I got to work with tons of different hilarious kids, and got to watch 
                        the faces of the young ones light up as they experienced riding the wind for the first time. I also got the chance to work 
                        with the Boys and Girls club of Spryfield, who were all adorable and seemed to have the time of their life.

                      Most recently, I've begun coaching professional VALORANT on a website called metafy. I've been playing VALORANT ever since
                        it came out, and after joining the Dalhousie varsity VALORANT team, I figured I was finally at a level where I felt like I 
                        could provide a good product to anyone who ordered my coaching. I have been relatively successful (I reached the top 15 coaches
                     on the site [out of 100] within my first month!) so far and I'm excited to keep working on this individual project!
